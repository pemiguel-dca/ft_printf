This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. 
This project doesn't implement all the conversions, only the following ones: cspdiuxX%
To use the following function you just need to run 'make' and after the creation of 'libftprintf.a' you can try the function yourself, but don't forget the compiler flag '-L. 'libftprintf.a'' to use the library you need.
